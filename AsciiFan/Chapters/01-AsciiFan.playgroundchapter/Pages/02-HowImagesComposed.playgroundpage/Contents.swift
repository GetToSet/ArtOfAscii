# How Images Composed

## Pixels

Images are made up of **pixels**. Think of them as tiny square blocks with a single, solid color.

### ðŸ”¬Pixel Discovery

* Experiment:
    Choose an image and then tap the ðŸ”Ž icon in the bottom right corner to bring up the magnifier. Drag it around to
    examine how pixels compose a whole image.

## Red, Green & Blue

Each pixel has a color. To store a color, we have to use a **color model** to measure them first. The **RGB Color model**
is mostly used to represent colors in digital world.

In **RGB color model**, all colors are mixed from lights three main colors: **red, green and blue** as well as an
**alpha** attribute to describe how *opaque* the color is.

This model is close to the way how screens on our devices works. For old monitors with low resolution, you can
even see lighting units in these three colors with a close-up look.

## Filters

**Filters** are used as the general technique for image processing. Mysterious it seems to be, a filter is more like a
mathematical function, receiving colors per pixel, recalculates them, producing a new image as output.

### ðŸ”¨Build Your First Image Filter

* Experiment:
    * In this experiment, we'll build a simple filter which takes red, green or blue component out of the source
    image.
    * Try to read and complete the following code snippet. When you finish it, run your code and tap the **R, G
    and B** button below the image to see whether it works.
