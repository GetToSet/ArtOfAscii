# Art of ASCII ‚Äî Introduction to Digital Image Processing

## What is an ASCII Art?

**ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** is a standard for electronic communication, which
contains 128 characters.

**ASCII arts** are artworks created with ASCII characters, which can be seen in many places where only textual data can
be transmitted, for example, within a terminal.

* Experiment:
    Head to the panel beside, and *tap the **run** button*, have fun experiencing the ASCII effects I've created.

## What We'll Learn by Generating ASCII Arts?

Examining how to generate ASCII Arts is a great way to explore the world of image processing. You'll be introduced with
**the RGB color model**, **histograms and equalization techniques** with piratical experiments, which can be a fun and
delightful.
