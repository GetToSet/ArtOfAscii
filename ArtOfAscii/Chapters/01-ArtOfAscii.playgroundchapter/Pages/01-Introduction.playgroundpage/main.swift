# Art of ASCII ‚Äî Introduction to Digital Image Processing

## ASCII Arts?

**ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** is a standard for electronic communication, which
contains 128 characters including letters, numbers and some control characters.

**ASCII arts** are artworks created with ASCII characters, which can be seen in many places where only textual data can
be transmitted, for example, within a computer terminal.

* Experiment:
    *Tap the **run** button* on the side panel. Have fun experiencing ASCII effects I've created.

## What Will We Learn by Generating ASCII Arts?

Examining how to generate ASCII Arts is a great way to explore image processing. You'll be introduced with
**the RGB color model, histograms and equalization techniques** with some piratical experiments, which are fun to play
with.
