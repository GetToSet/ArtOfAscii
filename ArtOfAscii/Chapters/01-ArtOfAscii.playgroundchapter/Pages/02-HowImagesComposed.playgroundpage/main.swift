# Basics: How Images Composed

## Pixels

Images are made of **pixels**. Each pixel is a tiny square block with a single, solid color.

### ðŸ”¬Pixel Discovery

* Experiment:
    Choose an image and then tap ðŸ”Ž to bring up the magnifier. Drag it around to examine how pixels compose a
    whole image.

## Red, Green & Blue

Colors are measured in **color models**. The **RGB Color model** is close to the way how screens work and therefore the
mostly used color model in digital world.

In **RGB color model**, all colors can be produced by lights in **red, green and blue**, while most images also include
an extra **alpha** channel to describe the opacity of a color.

## Filters

**Filtering** is a general technique for image processing. A **digital image filter** resembles a mathematical function,
which receives a raw image as a sequence of colors, performing a specific calculation and returns a new image.

### ðŸ”¨Your First Image Filter

* Experiment:
    * You'll build a simple filter which separates red, green or blue component out from the source image.
    * Try completing following code snippet. Run your code and tap the *R, G and B* button to verify whether it works.
