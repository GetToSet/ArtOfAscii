# Preprocessing: Grayscale, Histogram & Equalization

## Grayscale

Converting the image into a *grayscaled* version is the first step to the final ASCII art. This process involves
transforming each pixel's red, green and blue value to their average, which can be done by *multiplying a grayscale
matrix*.

According to researches, human eyes are way more sensitive to green than red and blue. To take this into consideration,
a dedicated set of coefficients can be applied.

### ðŸ”¨Grayscale Filtering

* Experiment:
    * You'll build a filter to turn an image into grayscaled version.
    * Try completing following code snippet. Run your code and tap the *Grayscale* button to verify whether it works.

## Histograms

Images with low contrast may produce ASCII arts that are hard to recognize, as the following figure shows.

ï¼ˆå›¾ï¼‰

**Histogram** is an effective tool for visualizing the distribution of tones in an image. The *X axis* represents *the
brightness* while the *Y axis* represents *the number of pixels at a specific brightness value*.

ï¼ˆå›¾ï¼‰

### ðŸ”¬Demystification of Histograms

* Experiment:
    * Choose an image and then tap ðŸ“Š to bring up the histogram. Tapping it again to show histograms for seperated red,
    green, and blue channel.
    * Try associating histograms with the distribution of tones and colors.

## Histogram Equalization

**Histogram Equalization** is a widely used technique to enhance the contrast of images by *redistributing tones to the
whole brightness range*, spreading out pixels that has intense frequency.

### ðŸ”¨Equalizing an Image

* Experiment:
    * You'll build a filter to apply **Histogram Equalization** to images
    * Try completing following code snippet. Run your code and tap the *contrast* button to verify whether it works.
