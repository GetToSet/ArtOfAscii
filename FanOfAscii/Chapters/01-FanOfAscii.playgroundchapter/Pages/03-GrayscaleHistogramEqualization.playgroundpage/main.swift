# Grayscale, Histogram & Equalization

## Grayscale

To achieve the final result, the first thing we need to do is converting the image into a *grayscaled* version.
We can achieve this by setting it's red, green and blue scalar to the same value, which is the average. With prior
knowledge,this task should be simple now. Just construct a grayscale matrix andâ€¦ it's done.

However, according to scientific researches, our eyes are more sensitive to green color than red and blue (actually,
green takes up almost 70%). To achieve better result, we can modify our coefficients a little bit, taking this into
consideration.

### ðŸ”¨Yet Another Image Filter

* Experiment:
    * In this experiment, we'll build another filter to turn a image into grayscaled version, with consideration.
    * Try to read and complete the following code snippet. When you finish, run your code and tap the *Switch to
    Grayscale* button below the image to see whether it works.

## Histograms

Now we've turned our image into grayscale and here comes another problem we have to solve: for some images, which are
too bright or too dark, the resulting ASCII arts may be hard to recognize, as the following figure shows.

**Histogram** is an effective tool for image processing. It visualizes the distribution of tones in an image. The X axis
represents the brightness, while the Y axis represents the relative number of pixels at that brightness value. The
following figure shows the same images as previous figure, along with histograms representing them.

### ðŸ”¬Demystification of Histograms

* Experiment:
    * Choose an image and then tap the *Show Histogram* icon below the image to show the histogram. Tap it again to
    see a histogram with separated red, green, and blue value.
    * Try to understand these graphs by associating them with tone and color distributions of images.

## Histogram Equalization

In this section we'll use a technique called **Histogram Equalization** to solve the previous problem. This technique
enhance the contrast level of images by *expanding light part to lightest and dark part to darkest*. For histogram's
perspective, it *widens* a histogram to its maximum width by redistributing colors from white to black.

### ðŸ”¨Equalize the Images

* Experiment:
    * In this experiment, we'll build a filter for **Histogram Equalization**.
    * Try to read and complete the following code snippet. When you finish it, run your code and tap the **Equalization**
    button below the image to see whether it works.
