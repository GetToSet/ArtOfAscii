# How Images Composed

## Pixels

Images are made up of **pixels**. Think of them as tiny square blocks with a single, solid color.

### ðŸ”¬Pixel Discovery

* Experiment:
    Choose an image and then tap the ðŸ”Ž icon in the bottom right corner to bring up the magnifier. Drag it around to
    examine how pixels compose a whole image.

## Red, Green & Blue

Each pixel has a color. To store a color, we have to use a **color model** to measure them first. The **RGB Color model**
is mostly used to represent colors in digital world.

In **RGB color model**, all colors are mixed from lights three main colors: **red, green and blue** as well as an
**alpha** attribute to describe how *opaque* the color is.

![RGB Color Model](rgb-model.png)

This model is close to the way how screens on our devices works. For old monitors with low resolution, you can
even see lighting units in these three colors with a close-up look.

## Filters

**Filters** are used as the general technique for image processing. Mysterious it seems to be, a filter is more like a
mathematical function, receiving colors per pixel, recalculates them, producing a new image as output.

### ðŸ”¨Your First Image Filter

* Experiment:
    * In this experiment, we'll build a simple filter which takes red, green or blue component out of the source
    image.
    * Try to read and complete the following code snippet. When you finish, run your code and tap the *R, G
    and B* button below the image to see whether it works.
