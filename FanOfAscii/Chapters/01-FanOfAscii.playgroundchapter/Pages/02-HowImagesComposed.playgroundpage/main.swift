# How Images Composed

## Pixels

Images are made up of **pixels** â€” tiny square blocks with a single, solid color.

### ðŸ”¬Pixel Discovery

* Experiment:
    Choose an image and then tap ðŸ”Ž to bring up the magnifier. Drag it around to examine how pixels compose a
    whole image.

## Red, Green & Blue

Colors are measured in **color models**. The **RGB Color model** is the one mostly used in digital world.

In **RGB color model**, all colors can be produced by lights in **red, green and blue**, while most images also include
an extra **alpha** channel to describe the opacity of a color.

The RGB model is close to the way how screens work. Lighting units in these three colors can be seen with a close-up
look on many old monitors with low resolution.

## Filters

**Filtering** is a general technique for image processing. A digital image filter resembles a mathematical function,
which receives pixel colors as a sequence, performing some calculations and returns a new image.

### ðŸ”¨Your First Image Filter

* Experiment:
    * You'll build a simple filter which separates red, green or blue component from the source image.
    * Try completing following code snippet. Run your code and tap the *R, G and B* button to verify whether it works.
